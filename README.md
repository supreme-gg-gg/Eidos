# Computer Vision from Scratch in C++

## Description

This is a project for educational purpose to implement CNN Image Classifier and TinyYOLO object detectio model from scratch using only Eigen for parallelized linear algebra in pure C++. The goal is to understand the underlying concepts of these models and how they work.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
- `include/`: Contains header files.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests.
- `build/`: Contains the build files (generated by CMake).

## How to Build

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
3. Navigate to `build/` and run: `cmake .. && make`# vision-from-scratch-cpp

## Inspecting Sample

Run `make` in `sample` to see how an implementation using MLPack, an existing C++ ML framework, would look like. This is just for reference and not part of the main project.
