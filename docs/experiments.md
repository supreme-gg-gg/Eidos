# Experiments with Eidos

This is not a tutorial for teaching the essential of Eidos but more of a description of what simple projects can be done potentially with the library and customizations.

The following datasets are good starting points:

- [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) (hand written digits): MLP, CNN

- [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist?resource=download&select=fashion-mnist_train.csv) (10 classes of clothing items): MLP, CNN

- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) (32x32 color images of 10 classes): CNN 
    - _(You need custom function to parse their binary image format)_

- [Flowers Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset?select=Testing_set_flower.csv) (5 types of flower images): CNN

- [Olivetti Faces Dataset](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html) (grayscale 64x64 images): CNN

- [Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/air-quality-data-set/data) (time series sensor data): RNN

- [IMDB Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/code) (binary classification): RNN 
    - _(You need custom tokenizer/embedding)_
